# Challenge Quiz

## Question: 

Kyle visits a market. Candy bar cost $2 each and he had only $ 30. He was disappointed. He wanted more. But when he reached the counter, he was amazed. There was a special sale. If you return 3 wrappers of the candy bar you will get one candy bar for free. So how many candy bars can he get?  


## Solution: 

Given that each candy bar costs $2, then I can buy 15 candy bars. 

First, Kyle has 15 candy bars with 15 wrappers.  

If I change this 15 wrappers with 5 new candy bars (Given that 3 wrappers make one new candy bar), in total Kyle will have 15 + 5 = 20 candy bars and 5 wrappers.

Kyle can still change this 5 wrappers so that he can have 1 candy bar and 2 wrappers. But this new candy bar has its own wrapper. So in total Kyle has 20 + 1 = 21 candy bars and 2 + 1 = 3 wrappers.

These new 3 wrappers can be converted to a candy bar.

So in total,  Kyle has 21 + 1 = 22 candy bars with 1 wrapper. He cannot convert more wrappers into candies.

Answer: 22 candy bars.
